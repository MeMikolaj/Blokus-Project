# Blokus-Project

Final Year Project. I fully programmed the Blokus Game (Board game) of type classic and duo (for 4 players and 2 players) using Python & PyGame.
The game involves basic computer strategies (random piece, largest piece, maximise possible moves in next turn, maximise possible moves next turn and minimise for opponents).

To run the project: install Pygame, run in the terminal and compute the main file.

While running: 
- Choose the type of the game by choosing one of the modes on the right side (rectangles).

In game:
- Turn pieces by clicking left and right arrow. Flip pieces by clicking up and down arrows.
- Choose the piece by clicking on it.
- Place the piece by clicking on a specific place on the board.

Rules of the game can be found:

I am still developing the project. Code isn't appropriately commented. Currently I am implementing mathematical strategy to "solve" the game in last few moves (computations can be done in reasonable time). On top of that, I am implementing a dynamic strategies and testing them against other strategies and human players.
Later on, I will do some more research and write the disertation document with all the pros and cons of my choices. 

All the algorithms can be easily optimised if one had more time.
