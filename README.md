# Blokus-Project

Final Year Project. I fully programmed the Blokus Game (Board game) of type classic and duo (for 4 players and 2 players) using Python & PyGame.
The game involves basic computer strategies (random piece, largest piece, maximise possible moves in next turn, maximise possible moves next turn and minimise for opponents).

To run the project: install Pygame, run in the terminal and compute the main file.

While running: 
- Choose the type of the game by choosing one of the modes on the right side (rectangles).

In game:
- Turn pieces by clicking left and right arrow. Flip pieces by clicking up and down arrows.
- Choose the piece by clicking on it.
- Place the piece by clicking on a specific place on the board.

Rules of the game can be found:

Many of the algorithms could be optimised and further developed.
